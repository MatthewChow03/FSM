## Basic FSM Implementations in C

Basic state machine to enter a looping state where a print action can be performed.

Both of these methods are not optimal, but they work alright when there are a small number of states and events.

### Nested Switch Statements

### Lookup Tables

### Other Options

Using C++, OOP can be used to improve FSM design. For example, polymorphism is the perfect solution for states performing different actions.
